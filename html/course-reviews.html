                    <p>This page contains a list of all the courses I've taken at the University of Alberta. You may find the description for each of these courses in the <a class="url" target="_blank" href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/catalogue">University of Alberta course catalogue</a>. For each course, I include a description of the course, tips for doing well, and the class GPA (for my class section). Unless otherwise noted, all courses are graded on a scale; i.e., professors look for "natural breaks" in the class grade to assign letter grades. For select courses, I give a shoutout to professors who went above and beyond in teaching. Please keep in mind that the difficulty and review I provide is subjective to my personal experiences immediately after finishing each course; your mileage may vary.</p>

                                    <p>This course was about 2/3 review from high school chemistry and 1/3 new material. Overall, it was a straightforward course; follow along the notes and do practice questions until you're familiar with the concepts to do well in this course. Dr. Taha's notes were completely hand-written when I took CHEM 101, so be prepared to write. As for the lab portion, it was pretty chill since you have tons of time to complete the lab. To do well in the lab, review the techniques you'll be doing before the lab, and take good notes, as you likely won't be able to use your phone to access the lab manual during the lab itself. Also, please, please, please do NOT wash your lab coat at home (it will likely be contaminated with chemicals you do not want mixing with your everyday clothes); either take it to an industrial cleaner or buy a new one when your lab coat becomes too dirty. The class average was 2.7/4.0. As for the grade cutoffs, in general, intro chem tends to be the following: A+ ≥ 92%, A ≥ 86%, A- ≥ 81%, B+ ≥ 77%, B ≥ 70%, B- ≥ 66%, C+ ≥ 60%, C ≥ 55%, C- ≥ 51%, D+ ≥ 48%, D ≥ 46%, and F < 46%. The course average tends to be around 66.5%. However, these numbers may change from year to year depending on your class.</p>

                                    <p>The 4 major units in this course included (i) atoms, (ii) molecules, (iii) gases, liquids, and solids, and (iv) main-group elements. The new material (i.e., likely not covered in high school chemistry) includes molecular orbital theory, crystalline solids, advanced materials, phase diagrams, and packing efficiency.</p>

Gordon Lee handwrites all of his notes and doesn't post to eClass, so get ready to write or have a buddy to write stuff for you.

Also, Dr. Grant is like the Terminator for marking exams; she marks all of them herself in a single day. Effective study techniques are to first understand key concepts&mdash;such as nucleophilic and electrophilic sites, protic and aprotic solvents, etc.&mdash;then practice as many questions as possible. Although a certain degree of memorization is necessary (like memorizing solvents for different reactions), this course is best learned through practice (all exams are 100% written).

                                    <p>PHYS 126 is an algebra-based course for life sciences students that extends many concepts you may have learned in high school. Dr. Wheelock was a decent lecturer with good notes and fair exams. However, the exam difficulty is very uniform between questions and the exams themselves are only out of 15 marks for 15 multiple choice questions, so the class distribution is pretty tight; try not to make careless mistakes. The class GPA was 2.7/4.0.</p>

                                    <p>The following units are taught: fluids, electric charges / forces / fields, electric potential, electric current, DC circuits, magnetism, magnetic flux, Faraday's law of induction, AC circuits, nuclear physics, and nuclear radiation. All of the topics presented are very surface level due to the course being algebra-based and not calculus-based, but it will provide all of the physics knowledge you need (alongside PHYS 124) to succeed on the MCAT.</p>

The lab sections are not mandatory to attend and are there as TA help sessions. You will complete labs in groups of 3-4 chosen for you in this course. Depending on your luck, you may need to do all of the work or share the work in the labs. My tips for succeeding are to know how to answer the questions in the practice exams and labs, as they are very similar in content to the exams. The class average was 2.7/4.0.</p>

Many of these topics show up over and over again in research settings (and whenever dealing with data), so make sure you understand the main idea behind each statistical test.</p>

                                    <p>This course is a much more in depth version of the genetics you learned in high school. In my opinion, BIOL 207 was a lot harder than BIOL 107, as it was easier to make mistakes and the concepts involved more moving parts. To be honest, it was the large lab component that saved my mark in this course. For inspiration, I received low 70s on all of my midterms (class average was high 60s) but somehow pulled through with an A. Although Dr. Locke is now retired, his exams were extremely similar to his practice exams. My top tips for doing well are to understand how to apply each of the concepts presented (e.g., restriction enzymes, transposons, Western blots) and to work through the exercises in the OGL textbook.

Dr. Clive's exams were fair and 100% written response, and they were extremely similar to his past exams. The midterm average was 66%. Although the lecture portion is fair, the labs are extremely hectic. In my first lab, nobody finished on time.

                                    <p>There are a ton of concepts covered in this coruse. You start with a review of NMR and mass spectroscopy, and you will be expected to draw a chemical compound based on the signals from both techniques. You then delve into conjugated unsaturated systems, aromatic compounds, and reactions of aromatic compounds. The next topic is about nucleophilic addition to carbonyl groups (e.g., aldehydes and ketones) and carbohydrates. You then learn about carboxylic acids and derivatives alongside nucleophilic addition-elimination at the acyl carbon. You also learn about lipids. The final few topics are about reactions at the alpha-carbon of carbonyl compounds (e.g., enols and enolates), condensation and conjugate addition reactions of carbonyl compounds, amines, and amino acids and proteins.</p>

This course is extremely fast-paced; I spent many hours learning and doing assignments. This course alongside CMPUT 275 were the heaviest courses I've taken at university. This class is divided evenly between first-year honors CS and second-year computer engineers, and it is tailored towards people with some knowledge of programming (though I had 0 knowledge of programming when I did this course). To succeed in this course, approach your learning in a hands-on manner. Although some memorization is required, the main point of this class is to have you become proficient at programming and problem-solving. The class GPA was 2.9/4.0.</p>

                                    <p>This course is half Python and half C++. In the first half of the course, you will learn the basics of programming (variables, statements, conditionals, loops). You will then learn functions, recursion, arrays, data structures, and testing and debugging. These concepts will be taught using Python. The first major assignment in my year was to implement the Huffman compression and decompression algorithm. In the second half of the course, you will learn how to program in C++ and apply it to more advanced algorithms. In particular, the second major assignment involved implementing the RSA cryptography algorithm to communicate between a computer and an Arduino. You will also learn about binary search and various sorting algorithms.</p>

This course focuses purely on algorithms and data structures in C++ (you will use C++ to program an Arduino). The best way to succeed here is to do a ton of practice, whether you use LeetCode, Kattis, HackerRank, etc. YouTube videos about specific algorithms may also be helpful. Perhaps the most stressful aspect about CMPUT 275 are the morning problems. In my year, morning problems were graded, 30-minute coding challenges that you needed to complete at the end of every class. The silver lining is that they are worth so little that you can get 0% on all of them and still pass the course with an A+. Be warned that CMPUT 275 is extremely fast-paced and will likely take up a huge portion of your time, so make sure to plan accordingly.</p>

                                    <p>In terms of concepts, you will learn the following classes of algorithms: brute force, divide and conquer, graph algorithms, and dynamic programming. Of note are the graph theory concepts like depth search first, breadth search first, and Dijkstra's algorithm. These graph concepts were used in the implementation of a Google Maps-esque project with an Arduino and a touchscreen display. You will also learn and implement common data structures such as linked lists, hash tables, binary trees, min/max heaps, etc. In terms of systems concepts, you will learn hardware basic (circuit design, input, output), programming pipeline (compile, link, execute), makefiles, memory hierarchy, and caching. In my year, we also had a final project where we proposed, implemented, and presented a project.</p>

One YouTube series that was of great help was <a class="url" href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra" target="_blank">3Blue1Brown's essense of linear algebra</a> as they give a fantastic gemoetrical perspective into the concepts you learn. Linear algebra concepts come back in the majority of your future CS, math, and engineering courses, so make sure to do well here.</p>

                                    <p>As with most introductions to linear algebra, you start by learning how to solve systems of linear equations with row and column operations. You then transition into vectors in n-space, matrix algebra, determinants, and linear transformations. The first part is likely the most intuitive portion of MATH 125. The second half of MATH 125 goes into more abstract topics such as eigenvalues and eigenvectors, complex numbers, dot product, cross product, orthogonality, and diagonalization. Since the second half of the course is more conceptually difficult, try to do as well as possible on pre-midterm material.</p>

                                    <p>Really cool and low-stress introduction to neuroscience. Each week, different lecturers come in to present on various topics ranging from psychiatry to neurosurgery. The course grade breakdown consists of two midterms worth 20% each and a final exam worth 60%. The first midterm will be the easiest exam you will ever write, as the class average is usually 90%+. Don't let this lull you into a false sense of security. The second exam is much more difficult relatively speaking, and the class average will be in the low 70s. The final exam is pretty reasonable and is on a difficulty level between the two midterms. All of the exams are multiple choice.</p>

                                    <p>I still have nightmares about the assignments and final exam from this course :<, so be warned. ENGG 130 is your standard introduction to statics, i.e., F<sub>net</sub> = 0. In this course, you will apply a bunch of seemingly random linear algebra concepts such as cross product, triple scalar product, determinants, and the such to solve really wacky 3D equilibrium problems. Don't worry about the math too much here; you will learn what all of it means in your linear algebra course (MATH 102) in the following semester. As I foreshadowed, this course is extremely computationally tedious (e.g., solving a system of equations with 7 unknowns). Each assignment may take a few hours of work just to chug through the algebra and geometry. To do well in this course, be EXTREMELY careful with your numbers and vectors, as one wrong number or sign can result in a catastrophically wrong answer. Also, try to do well on the assignments as the exams are quite difficult and will likely drag down your overall grade. Final word of advice: this course has consolidated exams across all sections, so no matter what prof you have, you will have the same exams. That means you can attend any prof's class and still do well. Also, check out <a class="url" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXKW_dKcpFh358S1rV5qBDw" target="_blank">Jeff Hanson</a> on YouTube; he is hands-down the single factor that saved my grade in this class.

                                    <p>As with a standard statics class, you will learn about particle equilibrium, moments, equilibrium in 2D and 3D, truss analysis, bending moment diagrams, dry friction, centroids, and moments of inertia. The first part of the course involves a ton of algebra and geometry. The second part of the course involves calculus and geometry.</p>

The second part of MATH 101 will be essential in multivariable calculus (MATH 209), so learn the concepts well!

These concepts will be applied to acoustic waves (e.g., bulk modulus, phase velocity, group velocity), which will lead to the power carried by waves. After this unit, you will cover optics. You will finish the course by considering light waves, which is arguably the most difficult part of this course because there are so many concepts that are similar yet very different to solve.</p>

Although technically an extension of calculus, this course takes a very different approach in terms of the rigour involved in the derivations and the way concepts are presented. At times, it will feel like the concepts are disconnected, as if you are learning a bag of tricks to solve ODEs and PDEs; in a sense, this is true. Differential equations are pretty fundamental in engineering, so make sure you learn the material in this course well.

For PDEs, you will learn how to solve the wave equation and the heat equation with many different boundary conditions.</p>

                                    <p>This course was a standard introduction to multivariable calculus. Tips for doing well include perusing <a class="url" href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/" target="_blank">Paul's Online Math Notes</a> and grinding through as many practice exams as possible. Important concepts in this course include the chain rule for partial derivatives, line integrals, surface integrals, divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem (especially if you're an EE/CompE/EngPhys student as electromagnetism is written in the language of vector calculus). The class GPA was 1.7/4.0 (yikes!).</p>

                                    <p>This course essentially finishes the Stewart calculus textbook. You will start by learning about partial derivatives (e.g., chain rule, Lagrange multipliers, gradient), move on to multiple integrals (in multiple coordinate systems), and finish with the grand finale of vector calculus. The vector calculus unit is arguably the most important as you learn line integrals, surface integrals, curl / div / grad, divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and Stokes' theorem. The course final is consolidated across all sections, so all students will face an equally difficult exam during finals season!</p>

                                    <p>This course can count as either a complementary studies elective or impact of technology on society (ITS) elective, but not both. If you're hesitant about a 300-level SOC course, don't worry; all of the  concepts are easy to understand. In my opinion, SOC 366 was a fantastic introduction to historical and contemporary work perspectives with a nice nod to Canadian industries. You also learn about engineering industries, as this course is restricted to engineering students. Per Nicole's syllabus, "this course will challenge you to understand the role of engineers in driving industrial and social transformation, and provide insights into how such broad change impacts engineering work itself." Nicole's exams are very fair, and they are part multiple choice, part written. The only thing is that you should get ready to read ~50 pages of the textbook each week, as the exam will contain content from the text. Honestly, the best way to do well is to take good notes as the exams are open book. The class GPA was 3.4/4.0.</p>

                                    <p>This course will begin with an introduction to the "old" and "new" economy. You will then transition to management, innovation and failure, unions and industrial relations, labour markets, inequality, and diversity at work. You will finish by exploring households, family, care, the meaning of work, alternative approaches, and the future of work (especially related to technological change). Many of the concepts are directly relevant to our everyday lives, so I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to any interested engineering student.</p>

My top tips for doing well is to create a killer formula sheet, practice as many assignment and practice exam questions as possible, and develop a strategy for recognizing when different tests or probability distributions are used. In my year, the stat labs were optional attendance to any open section. I would recommend attending as the TAs pretty much just tell you the answers to the labs. This class had hard grade cutoffs.

                                    <p>This course is broken into two major parts: probability and statistical tests. In the probability section, you will learn about the axioms of probability, random variables, and discrete and continuous probability distributions. The statistical test portion include t-tests, linear regression, ANOVA, and inferences for proportions. Linear regression will be a HUGE focus in this course, as it is extremely important in many future courses (and likely in your future career). As such, it will also be a major focus in the exams, so ensure you know it inside and out.</p>

The major techniques include loop analysis, mesh analysis, superposition, source transformation, Thevenin theorem, and Norton theorem. The latter part of this course introduces AC circuit analysis in the frequency domain; all of the DC techniques apply to the AC case. The course finishes with an introduction to complex power, magnetic coupling, and transformers.</p>

The lectures will introduce you to the relevant physics concepts and statistical chops you need to complete the lab in the following week. You typically have one week to complete the lab report, but for the big formal lab report, you'll have two-to-three weeks to write up to 10 pages of "research." Be warned, you will likely need to do self-studying to learn how to use the statistical tests presented. You will also learn how to use Python to analyze data (though if you're lazy or are a masochist, you're allowed to use Excel for analysis later on). The coolest experiment in this course (in my humble opinion) is the superconductor lab, where you get to make a superconductor and hover a magnet over it when the superconductor is cooled with liquid nitrogen. Do well in this course as your course mark is determined at the end of PHYS 292B in the next semeseter, which takes into account your grades in PHYS 292A.</td>

                                    <p>Circuits II is a continuation of circuits I. All of the network theorems and analysis techniques (minus magnetic coupling and complex power) apply in this course, so make sure you know them by heart. In my opinion, the best way to do well in this course is to grind practice problems and sample exams. Top tips: know Norton, Thevenin, mesh, and loop analysis; make a nice summary sheet on bode plots and op-amps; do a bunch of practice questions; and you'll be golden. The class GPA for this course was 3.1/4.0.</p>

                                    <p>The first part of this course focuses on analyzing first- and second-order circuits (i.e., using differential equations). Don't worry if you're rusty at solving ODEs—this course presents many shortcuts to solving them. The second part of this course analyzes circuits in the frequency domain. Here, we rely on phasors and eventually the Laplace transform. Bode plots are also introduced to analyze the frequency response of circuits. The third part of this course studies operational amplifiers and diodes, which play a key role in larger integrated circuits.</p>

                                <td>This course is largely a review of Fourier series and Laplace transforms from MATH 201 (differential equations). At the start of the course, you cover fundamental concepts like linearity, superposition, BIBO stability, memory, convolution, and elementary signal properties. You then build on these concepts with linear time invariant (LTI) systems and analyze these systems using Fourier and Laplace. You then learn the relationship between the Fourier and Laplace transforms. You also touch on cool topics such as AM radio and filter design (filters are also covered in ECE 203). Overall, this was a very straightforward course where you prove various properties then use them to solve computational problems. If can do the assignments and practice exams, you will do well in the course. As for the prof, Horacio was pretty great at teaching and his exams were quite fair. The class GPA for this course was 3.1/4.0.</td>

                                    <p>If you liked Newtonian mechanics, you'll love this course! This was one of the most difficult classes I've taken, courtesy of Kirk, but also one of the most satisfying and beautiful courses I've had the pleasure of studying. Kirk is extremely passionate about teaching physics and has very high expectations for his students. He also programmed a physics simulator on the Apple App Store, which is frequently used in class to show some cool simulations. The class GPA for this course was 2.8/4.0.</p>

                                    <p>The most difficult part about this course is setting up the equations and being extremely diligent with algrebra/calculus. Each assignment took multiple hours to complete, so beware. Nonetheless, you will prove interesting problems in the assignments, such as: (i) Is there a contradiction in Netwon's third law for two charges approaching each other from orthogonal angles? (ii) What is the angular frequency of a spring on a rotating system? (iii) Why do planets orbit the sun such that the line between the planet and the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times? (iv) How do we generate symmetry? To do well in this course, understand the fundamental theorems well, be careful with your computations, and practice, practice, practice!</p>

                                    <p>The first half of this course reviews many concepts from first year physics but takes them one step further; you'll learn Newtonian mechanics in polar and cylindrical coordiantes, intrinsic coordinates, velocity-dependent forces (e.g., drag), linear and angular momentum, and energy in the context of vector calculus. Then, you will analyze oscillating systems: damped oscillations, coupled oscillators, and small oscillations. The second half of this course is where things get spicy. You first prove the Euler-Lagrange equations and other topics in calculus of variations (e.g., geodesic problems, Brachistochrone problem) then use the Euler-Lagrange equation in the context of Lagrangian mechanics. Lagrangian mechanics is a powerful extension of Newton's second law in scalar form, and you will be able to solve increasingly complex problems such as the double pendulum problem in an algorithmic manner. Lagrangian mechanics leads to one of the most beautiful theorems about symmetry and conserved quantities: Noether's theorem. Towards the end of the course, you will learn about two-body central force problems, an extension of Lagrangian mechanics, which plays a critical role in orbital mechanics and quantum mechanics. Finally, you will cover the basics of Hamiltonian mechanics.</p>

                                    <p>Ever watched Intestellar or wondered what Einstein did? Well now you can learn all about it! This course was a whirlwind introduction to special relativity, quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, and particle physics. JP is a pretty chill and funny prof, so you're in good hands in this course (though I'm not a fan of the PowerPoint slides you learn from). The special relativity unit is arguably the wackiest, where you learn about time dilation, length contraction, and relativistic mechanics. You will also learn that E = mc<sup>2</sup> is simply a special case of the more general energy-momentum relationship, E<sup>2</sup> = m<sup>2</sup>c<sup>4</sup> + p<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> (this relationship will be derived by integrating the derivative of relativistic momentum with respect to position). After special relativity, you'll learn how light and charge became quantized and then delve into wave-particle duality alongside the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. You will then derive the Schrodinger equation and see how it leads to many crazy phenomena like quantum tunnelling and the EPR paradox. You will finish the course by deriving the quantum numbers (which form the basis for modern chemistry) and see the necessity for relativistic quantum mechanics. The class GPA for this course was 2.6/4.0.</p>

                                    <p>Honestly, the best way to do well in this course is to take advantage of the extremely easy quizzes as the midterm and final will likely drag down your mark. For the special relativity unit, understand the meaning behind every equation, as plug and chug will not work here. For quantum mechanics, learn how to solve the Schrodinger equation and how to interpret and use the equations you derive from it. For most students, special relativity is a lot more difficult to understand than the quantum mechanics unit.</p>

At the end of this course, you will choose an experiment out of a list of prescribed experiments, write up a lab report, and present your findings in front of the class. Also similar to 292A, many of the statistical concepts taught in the lecture sessions are quite advanced for someone without having taken an introductory statistics course, but the application of the tests are quite straightforward. This course was overall pretty chill and a good opportunity to hang out with the engineering physics cohort (this class is only for engphys students). The class GPA for this course was 3.1/4.0.</td>
