                    <!-- intro -->
                    <p>This page contains a guide on getting involved in research as someone with little to no prior experiences. This will be a general guide for all types of research (e.g., basic science, computational, engineering). For context, I have been involved in neuroscience, science education, biomedical engineering, bioinformatics, and clinical research during my undergrad and during medical school.</p>

                    <h3 class="small-spacer">How do I get involved in research?</h3>
                    <p>There a few ways to seek research experiences as an undergraduate student or even high school student:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        <ol class="ordered-list">
                            <li>Cold email the Principal Investigator (PI; this is what I did for most of my research positions);</li>
                            <li>Ask someone you know to connect you to the professor;</li>
                            <li>Connect with the professor at a conference or networking event; and/or</li>
                            <li>Start your own research project and find a PI who is willing to supervise it.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>One of the most important pieces of advice given to me is that <strong>PIs enjoy when people take interest in their research</strong>. Oftentimes, undergraduate students do not have the relevant skills for research that interests them. When I was reaching out to PIs, I certainly did not know how to do the research they were doing. However, you can demonstrate enthusiasm in the research the PI does&mdash;everything else can be learned on site. As such, your initial message or email to the PI should focus on their research and why you find it fascinating.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As a general rule of thumb, PIs ideally want undergraduate students who are (i) interested in their research, (ii) have a decent GPA (usually >3.0/4.0), and (iii) can commit to a full-time position in the summer (and ideally continue in the future). The reason for the GPA part is because many summer student grants for research depend heavily on GPA (and prior research experience). If you have a low GPA, you can still find a research position. Again, many PIs look for interest rather than ability in undergraduate students.</p>

                    <span class="med-spacer bottom-border"></span>
                    <h3 class="small-spacer">How do I reach out to PIs via email?</h3>
                    <p>Below is an email template I used. Keep in mind that PIs are usually extremely busy people who receive 100+ emails a day, so don't take it personally if they respond slowly or not at all. As a general rule of thumb, email again after 1-2 weeks have passed since your original email if you don't receive anything back from the PI (or email their administrative assistant, if applicable).</p>

                        <p>Dear Dr. [NAME HERE],</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            My name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a [YOUR DEGREE] student at [UNIVERSITY]. [ONE SENTENCE INTRO OF YOURSELF]. Given my current research interests in [FIELD], I found your research with [RESEARCH TOPIC] to be fascinating. Would it be possible to have a chat about potential opportunities in your lab?
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I was particularly interested in your research on [SPECIFIC RESEARCH ITEM]. With my background in [RELEVANT SKILL OR EXPERIENCE], I see potential synergies in translating my skills into work in your lab.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I have attached my CV and transcripts to this email. Please let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                    <br>
                    <p>Don't forget to attach your resume/CV and transcript to the email! Notice that this email is short and sweet&mdash;many PIs don't have the time to read through an essay, so keep your email short and to the point.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Best of luck on finding a research position :)</p>
